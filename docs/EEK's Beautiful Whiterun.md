## **No Tree Circle Braziers**
- Removes the braziers around the Kynareth tree
- Removes the warming hands idle marker next to a brazier



## **No Tree Circle Braziers for Lux Orbis**
- Removes the braziers around the Kynareth tree
- Removes the warming hands idle marker next to a brazier
- Removes light markers added by Lux Orbis. Choose between this or the normal version


## **Revert Whiterun Market**
- Re-enables some of vanilla/JK's decor and disables some of EEK's Whiterun decor around the whiterun market, like the vegetable stands
- I mostly did this to get rid of the ugly vegetable stands


## **EEK Tree Swap** (*Base Object Swapper*)
  - For some reason, EEK's Whiterun uses its own base tree object for its Aspen trees, even though it's using vanilla models.
  - This uses Base Object Swapper to change it back to the vanilla base object, meaning your favorite tree mods, that potentially change tree records, can take priority. Use this if you're using Blubbo's Aspens.
  - Theoretically could be used with other EEK's Whiterun versions if they have the same issue
